# Simple-Date-Class

I had created a simple date class functions using the Gregorian calendar using C++ and Microsoft Visual Studio.  The function GetDate() would get the date and year in format dd/mm/yyyy.  The user is unable to manually type any of the dates as it is not able to accept input into the keyboard.
